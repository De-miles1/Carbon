# Carbon
This blockchain-based system for carbon emission monitoring and credit trading was developed on the FISCO BCOS blockchain platform. The Smart Contracts were written in the Solidity programming language, which means Ethereum developers who are interested in carbon emission monitoring can explore this smart contract. The project is down for now but the smart contract can be reused upon updating to the latest functions.
